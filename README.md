### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
Depending on how my initial experiments go my idea for this project may change. At this point I am either planning on doing a background with only certain elements moving such as a room with a window in it and maybe a fireplace, or a production line in a industrial factory - or something more shape based with flowers and vines because I'd like to work on my skills using bezier curves and such.
On second thoughts I don't really mind what I make as long as it's reasonably challenging and I'm using some new techniques.
